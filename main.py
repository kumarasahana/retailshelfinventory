Retail shelf inventory monitoring using OpenCV involves applying computer vision techniques to analyze images or video streams of retail shelves to detect, classify, and count products, as well as to identify empty spaces or misplaced items. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing such a system:

Steps for Retail Shelf Inventory Monitoring in OpenCV
1. Capture Images or Video Streams
Use a camera to capture images or a video feed of the shelves.
Ensure proper lighting and camera angle for clear visibility of all items.
2. Preprocess the Images
Convert the images to grayscale for easier processing.
Apply Gaussian blur or other smoothing techniques to reduce noise.
Use histogram equalization to enhance contrast if needed.
Python
import cv2

# Read the image
image = cv2.imread("shelf_image.jpg")

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Gaussian blur
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

# Display the preprocessed image
cv2.imshow("Preprocessed Image", blurred)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
3. Detect Shelf Regions
Use edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detection) to identify shelf edges.
Apply Hough Line Transform or contour detection to segment shelf regions.
Python
edges = cv2.Canny(blurred, 50, 150)

# Detect lines using Hough Line Transform
lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(edges, 1, np.pi / 180, threshold=100, minLineLength=100, maxLineGap=10)

# Draw lines on the image
for line in lines:
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = line[0]
    cv2.line(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Detected Shelf Regions", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
4. Segment Products
Use contour detection to isolate individual products.
Optionally, use color-based segmentation (e.g., k-means clustering) or template matching for better accuracy.
Python
# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Draw contours
for contour in contours:
    (x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
    if w > 30 and h > 30:  # Filter small contours
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Segmented Products", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
5. Classify Products
Use a machine learning or deep learning model (e.g., a pretrained CNN) to classify the products.
Train the model on a dataset of product images and use the model to predict the class of each detected product.
Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be integrated with OpenCV for this step.
6. Count Products
Keep track of the bounding boxes of detected products.
Count the number of boxes for each product class.
7. Detect Empty Spaces
Identify regions with no detected products.
Use background subtraction or train a model to recognize empty shelf areas.
Python
# Example of detecting empty shelf space
for i, contour in enumerate(contours):
    (x, y, w, h) = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
    if w > 30 and h > 30:  # Filter small contours
        # Check if the region is empty
        roi = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        if roi.mean() > 200:  # High mean intensity indicates empty space
            cv2.putText(image, "Empty", (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 0, 255), 2)

cv2.imshow("Empty Spaces", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
8. Generate Analytics
Store the results (e.g., product counts, empty spaces) in a database.
Visualize the data using dashboards or reports.
Tools and Techniques
Object Detection Models: Use models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN for accurate product detection and classification.
Background Subtraction: Useful for detecting changes on shelves over time.
OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Detect and read product labels or barcodes for identification.
